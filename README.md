An XML-model for encoding expressive music performances. The ODD schema definition and documentation will undergo a comprehensive revision in early 2020! More background information, details, sample encodings, etc. will follow. The [schema documentation](https://axelberndt.github.io/MPM/) is published in the ´gh-pages´ branch and also available as release asset. The official API and expressive MIDI rendering engine are integrated with the [meico](https://github.com/cemfi/meico) framework, ready to be used by application developers. Users of the meico app can also already take advantage of MPM's capabilities.
