# Music Performance Markup (MPM)

An XML-model for encoding expressive music performances. The ODD schema definition and documentation will get a comprehensive revision in early 2020! The official API and expressive MIDI rendering engine are integrated with the [meico](https://github.com/cemfi/meico) framework, ready to be used by application developers. Users of the meico app can also already take advantage of MPM's capabilities.
