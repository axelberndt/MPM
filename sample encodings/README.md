This folder provides a series of mostly small, illustrative examples of the Music Performance Markup. 

The file `minimal.mpm` is a minimum valid MPM document, probably mostly interesting for those who edit MPM in an XML editor. 

All other datasets are complete musical examples. All can be opened in the official MPM editor and analysis software [MPM Toolbox](https://github.com/axelberndt/MPM-Toolbox). To do so, copy the whole folder to your system, load (or drag and drop) the `.mpr` file (MPM Toolbox Project file) in MPM Toolbox and start exploring the pieces and performances encoded there. In the MPM tree you can find comment tags that give further introduction and background to the respective performances. Most examples contain audio renderings of the performances in `mp3` format you can listen to without MPM Toolbox. For an introduction to MPM Toolbox, start with the dedicated tutorial project "Max Reger - Moment Musical".
